# Conway's Game of Life
A fun weekend programming challenge to make Conway's game of life with vanilla javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Summary
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
